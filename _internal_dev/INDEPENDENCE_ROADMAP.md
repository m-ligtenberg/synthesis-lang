## Technical Architecture

### Compiler Components
1. Lexer (Nom-based, existing)
2. Parser (Custom AST generation)
3. Semantic Analyzer
4. Intermediate Representation
5. Code Generation (LLVM/WebAssembly)
6. Optimization Passes

### Runtime Characteristics
- Stream-based execution model
- Real-time performance priority
- Low-overhead memory management
- GPU/Hardware acceleration
- Cross-platform compatibility

### Type System Features
- Gradual typing
- Automatic conversions
- Domain-specific constraints
- Inference for creative domains

## Performance Goals
- Compilation speed: < 500ms for typical projects
- Runtime overhead: < 5% compared to native code
- WebAssembly bundle size: < 2MB
- Startup time: < 100ms

## Ecosystem Considerations
- Open-source development
- Community-driven extensions
- Plugin/Module marketplace
- Comprehensive documentation

## Potential Challenges
- Performance parity with Rust
- Maintaining low-level control
- Cross-platform consistency
- Avoiding feature creep

## Success Metrics
- Benchmark performance vs. existing creative coding platforms
- Community adoption rate
- Number of community-created modules
- Performance in real-world creative projects

## Long-term Vision
Create a programming language that:
- Democratizes creative technology
- Prioritizes artist/musician workflow
- Provides professional-grade performance
- Remains accessible and intuitive
